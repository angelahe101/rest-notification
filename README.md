# rest-notification
This script will provide an alert on my desktop every 20 minutes with the message: "Time to pet Lola and look at the tree outside! It's important to rest your eyes." It uses a custom icon (a cartoon of my dog) and works on Windows. The custom icon is available for download, or you can use your own.
